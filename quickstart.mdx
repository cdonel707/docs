## Prepare Your Ingredients

Before you can start making applesauce, gather your essentials: apples (about 6), a little bit of water, sugar, and cinnamon for flavor!

### Peel, Core, and Cut

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="apple-alt" title="Step 1: Peel and Core the Apples">
    First, peel your apples to get rid of the skin. Then, core them by removing the seeds and stems. Finally, cut the apples into small chunks—this will make the cooking process faster.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="utensils" title="Step 2: Cook the Apples">
    Toss your apple chunks into a pot and add about half a cup of water. Cover the pot, and cook the apples on medium heat until they’re soft (this takes about 15-20 minutes). Stir occasionally to prevent burning!

### Mash and Flavor

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="blender" title="Step 3: Mash 'Em Up">
  Once your apples are nice and soft, it's time to mash them! You can use a potato masher for a chunky texture or a blender for a smoother consistency. Feel free to add a little water if it's too thick.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="spices" title="Step 4: Add Sweetness and Spice">
  Now that your apples are mashed, add sugar to taste, and sprinkle in cinnamon for a classic applesauce flavor. Stir everything together and let it cook for another 5 minutes to meld the flavors.
