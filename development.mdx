## Prepare Your Garden

Before you can start growing apple trees, you’ll need apple seeds or saplings, healthy soil, and a sunny location in your garden.

### Planting Your Tree

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="apple-alt" title="Step 1: Prepare the Soil">
    First, ensure your soil is well-drained and slightly acidic. Dig a hole twice the width of the root ball and deep enough to accommodate the roots. Gently place the sapling or seed in the hole.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="utensils" title="Step 2: Plant and Water">
    After placing the tree in the hole, fill it with soil and lightly pack it down to remove air pockets. Water the base thoroughly to help the roots settle.

### Nurture Your Growing Tree

<Accordion icon="water" title="Step 3: Regular Watering">
  Water your apple tree consistently, especially in dry conditions. Aim for about 1 inch of water per week during the growing season. Adding mulch around the base of the tree can help retain moisture and suppress weeds.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="tree" title="Step 4: Pruning and Support">
  Pruning your apple tree during the dormant season will encourage healthy growth. Remove any dead or weak branches to allow more sunlight and air circulation. If needed, use stakes or supports to help the tree grow straight and tall.
